Technology used:

HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
HTML is the main building block of the website. It structures the content on each page, like headers, paragraphs, links, images, and forms.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
CSS is used to style the website. It controls things like layout, colors, fonts, and how the site adapts to different screen sizes, making the website look good on both desktop and mobile.

JavaScript (JS)
JavaScript adds interactivity to the website, like handling the login function, making the slideshow work, validating form data, and creating other dynamic features that make the site more engaging for users.

CSS Media Queries
Media queries are part of CSS and are used to make the website responsive. They adjust how the site looks depending on the screen size, so it works well on both phones and computers.

Forms (HTML Forms + JavaScript)
Forms are used for collecting user input, like the login form. HTML is used to create the structure of the form, and JavaScript is used to check that the form is filled out correctly before it’s submitted.

Links
Links in HTML (using <a> tags) let users navigate the website. They connect different pages, such as from the merchandise page to the cart page or from the "About Me" page to social media profiles.

Images (HTML <img> Tags)
Images are used to show pictures, like product images or event promotions. The <img> tag in HTML allows us to add images and style them to fit the page layout.

Flexbox and Grid Layout (CSS)
Flexbox and Grid are CSS tools used for creating flexible layouts. Flexbox helps with positioning items (like the header or navigation), while Grid is used to arrange products on the merch page in a neat and responsive way.

JavaScript Functions
JavaScript functions are used to make the website more dynamic. For example, they handle the login process, toggle the cart display, and allow users to add items to their cart.

CSS Transitions
CSS transitions create smooth effects on the website, like making the product boxes grow when hovered over. This makes the site feel more interactive and visually interesting.

External Fonts (e.g., 'Bebas Neue')
External fonts like 'Bebas Neue' are used to improve the look of the website. They help give the site a unique style and match its branding.
