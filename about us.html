            Drake, a Canadian rapper and vocalist, quickly rose to prominence after entering the music scene in 2006. His ability to blend introspective rap with R&B crooning helped him create chart-topping albums like Take Care (2011) and Scorpion (2018), along with Grammy-winning singles such as “Hotline Bling.” Beyond his solo success, Drake's involvement in helping other artists, including sponsoring The Weeknd and starting the OVO Sound label, solidified his place in the music industry. By the second decade of his career, he was not just a musician but a cultural force, with albums like Honestly, Nevermind (2022) and For All the Dogs (2023) becoming global events.<br></br>
           
            Initially, Drake gained fame for his role as Jimmy Brooks on Degrassi: The Next Generation, but by 2006, he transitioned to music with a series of mixtapes. His breakthrough came in 2007 when his song “Replacement Girl” was featured on BET's 106 & Park. As his popularity grew, he garnered attention from major labels, with support from Kanye West, Jay-Z, and Lil Wayne. In 2009, his single “Best I Ever Had” climbed the charts, and after signing with Universal Motown, Drake released the EP So Far Gone. It peaked at number six on the Billboard 200 and earned him a Juno Award for Rap Recording of the Year.<br></br>
           
            Drake's debut album, Thank Me Later (2010), included collaborations with artists like Jay-Z, Kanye West, and Lil Wayne, debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 and going platinum. However, Drake felt the album was rushed, leading to Take Care (2011), which received critical acclaim and solidified his position as a leading figure in global music.<br></br>
           
            In 2012, Drake began working on Nothing Was the Same, released in 2013. The album spawned several hits, topped global charts, and earned Grammy nominations. Afterward, his mixtape If You're Reading This It's Too Late (2015) debuted at number one and became an instant success. This was followed by a collaborative mixtape with Future, What a Time to Be Alive (2015), which also debuted at number one.<br></br>
           
            In 2016, Drake released Views, which continued his chart dominance. Featuring his reflections on Toronto, it debuted at number one and was supported by the hit “Hotline Bling.” Later that year, he released More Life, a playlist that included collaborations with artists like Kanye West and Travis Scott. The album became his seventh consecutive number-one release.<br></br>
           
            Throughout his career, Drake maintained his presence in the music world through constant chart-topping hits, Grammy wins, and meme-worthy moments. He has become not just a musician but a cultural icon, influencing both the music industry and global pop culture. His evolution from a rapper and singer to a business mogul with OVO Sound and his collaborations with emerging artists demonstrate his versatility and lasting influence in the music world.<br></br>

          Kanye West, a highly influential and controversial figure in the early 21st century, rose from a hip-hop beatmaker to a global superstar. Known for his genre-defying sound, West has maintained a streak of chart-topping, multi-platinum albums, and nearly two dozen Grammy Awards. His early production work led to a major-label contract and three classic albums: The College Dropout (2004), Late Registration (2005), and Graduation (2007). These albums, alongside his innovative sampling techniques, redefined the boundaries of hip-hop and pushed the genre forward.<br></br>
   
    West's artistry evolved with his 2008 album 808s & Heartbreak, which featured his use of auto-tune and introduced a more emotional, introspective style. He followed this with My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy (2010), widely considered his magnum opus, and Yeezus (2013), an industrial-leaning album that challenged conventions. His creative output didn’t stop there, with albums like The Life of Pablo (2016), Ye (2018), and a gospel album, Jesus Is King (2019). By 2020, his album Donda further cemented his place as one of the most influential and controversial figures in music.<br></br>
   
    Born in Atlanta and raised in Chicago, West’s early life was shaped by his mother, Donda West, an English professor who played a crucial role in his development. Kanye dropped out of college to pursue music, eventually learning the art of production from local producer No I.D. His big break came when he began working with Roc-A-Fella in the late 1990s, producing tracks for artists like Jay-Z. West’s production style, characterized by heavy sampling, was showcased in Jay-Z’s The Blueprint (2001), particularly on the tracks "Takeover" and "Izzo (H.O.V.A.)."<br></br>
   
    After years of producing for others, West finally launched his own solo career. His 2004 debut album The College Dropout was delayed after a car accident, but he used his recovery time to create the hit single "Through the Wire," which became the album’s defining moment. The album went on to win critical acclaim and several Grammy Awards, including Best Rap Album. In 2005, he released Late Registration, which produced hits like "Gold Digger" and "Touch the Sky," winning the Grammy for Rap Album of the Year.<br></br>
   
    West’s influence continued to grow, and by the late 2000s, he became known for his outspoken personality and public controversies. These traits were reflected in his music, with his albums increasingly exploring fame, inner turmoil, and societal issues. His music career reached new heights with the release of Graduation and continued to redefine mainstream hip-hop throughout the 2010s.<br></br>
   
    In addition to his music, West ventured into fashion, entrepreneurship, and politics, further cementing his global influence. His Yeezy brand became a cultural phenomenon, and his outspoken views on social and political issues kept him in the public eye. Despite his polarizing persona, West remains one of the most important and influential figures in modern music, continuing to challenge artistic and societal norms.<br></br>

          Travis Scott, born Jacques Webster in Houston, is known for his distinctive psychedelic trap style, blending heavily processed vocals with half-sung/half-rapped flows. Rising from the early 2010s, he quickly gained fame with collaborations and solo projects. His debut studio album, Rodeo (2015), reached number three on the Billboard 200, followed by two more number-one albums: Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight (2016) and Astroworld (2018). Scott's genre-crossing style and collaborations with artists like Rihanna, Drake, and SZA established him as one of the most influential musicians of the 2010s. Despite controversies, including the tragic 2021 Astroworld festival, Scott continued to dominate the charts, releasing UTOPIA in 2023.<br></br>
     
      Scott's journey began in Houston, where he formed the duo "The Graduates" with Chris Holloway in 2009. After a short-lived partnership with OG Chess in 2011, he dropped out of college and moved to Los Angeles. There, he connected with major industry figures like T.I. and Kanye West. As an in-house producer for GOOD Music, Scott contributed to the label's 2012 Cruel Summer compilation. His debut mixtape, Owl Pharaoh (2013), earned a BET Hip Hop Award nomination. The project featured collaborations with T.I., 2 Chainz, Toro y Moi, and Justin Vernon of Bon Iver.<br></br>
     
      In 2015, Scott released Rodeo, which featured hits like "3500" and "Antidote." The album debuted at number three on the Billboard 200 and became a commercial success. Throughout 2016, Scott continued to build his presence with collaborations such as "Bake Sale" with Wiz Khalifa, "FML" with Kanye West, and "Pick Up the Phone" with Young Thug and Quavo. His second studio album, Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight, debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and included contributions from André 3000, Kid Cudi, and Kendrick Lamar.<br></br>
     
      In 2017, Scott's success continued with "Butterfly Effect," which went platinum, and the collaborative project Huncho Jack, Jack Huncho with Quavo. Later that year, he released Astroworld, which debuted at number one and featured the hit single "Sicko Mode." The album, named after a now-demolished Houston amusement park, became a cultural phenomenon and solidified Scott's status as a major figure in the music industry.<br></br>
     
      Scott's artistic influence extended beyond music. Known for his innovative performances, fashion collaborations, and business ventures, he became a staple in mainstream pop culture. He also became a voice for younger generations, pushing the boundaries of hip-hop and transforming it into a more experimental genre. His music and collaborations with other artists helped shape the landscape of modern rap.<br></br>
